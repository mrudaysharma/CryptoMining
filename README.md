Method to do crypto mining

## What are the way to do Mining?

There are two way people do mining 
1.	Either we join existed pool. Where we can join other miners 
2.	Or we do it by ourself. 

### Pool Mining
Mining pools were born to aggregate low performance hardware owners in order to have a chance to compete with high performance farms. These pools aggregate hashing capability, dividing blocks assigned by blockchain and related profits.
This results in higher probability to be rewarded but also in lower rewarding for each block mined. Pool earning is in a small percentage “donated” when pooler takes away his profit and transfer it away from the pool (maybe to a personal protfolio or an exchange site).

**Pros**

- Pooled mining generates a steadier income.
- Pooled mining can generate a 1-2% higher income (before fees, if any) due to long polling provided by the pools.
- Pooled mining allows to choose between many cryptocoins, so you can switch between different Cryptocoins experiencing what best fit your expectations

**Cons**
- Pool mining can suffer interruptions from outages at the pool provider (Pools are subject to DOS attacks and have other downtimes, too. Backup pools and solo mining can be configured for these cases.)
- Pooled mining tends to generate a smaller income due to fees being charged and transaction fees not being cashed out (There are zero fee pools. Until now, transaction fees are not cashed out by any pool)
- Pools might be part of attack scenarios.

### Solo Mining
Solo mining means that you are mining blocks directly from blockchain you are joining. This requires to you to have a portfolio before starting, toghether with mining software. This results in lower probability to be rewarded but also in higher rewarding rate for each block mined.

**Pros**
- Solo mining is less prone to outages resulting in higher uptime.
- Solo mining doesn’t incur any fees.

**Cons**

- Solo mining tends to generate more erratic income.
- Solo mining wastes time due to only supporting getwork pull.
